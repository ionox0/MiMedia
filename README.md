MISSION
---
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a super tiny webapp **in CoffeeScript** that does the following:

  * stores data from the following endpoint in a Backbone Collection:

  > https://api.qa.mimedia.com/2.0/mimetypesfull/supported/list

  * displays the collection in the form of a **sortable** list
  * displays the total count of each type of mimetype somewhere in the webapp (ie. images, video, audio, documents)

RULES
---
  * You can use any external librar(y|ies) you want, as long as the end result is a list view that a user can click to sort.
  * It is 100% acceptable to do it in JavaScript but CoffeeScript is preferable, as we use it internally.
  * This project must be stored using Git, preferably through GitHub in the form of a public or private repository, as your commit logs will also count.

BONUS
---
You'll get some awesomesauce bonus points if you involve the following:

  * Bower
  * Grunt or Gulp
  * Marionette.js
  * Sass (we use the SCSS flavor)

SUBMISSION
---
Take as long as you need to complete this, but it's preferable if it's under a week. Submit the URL of the repository upon completion for review to the staffer that you're working with.

QUESTIONS
---
If you have any questions, feel free to send them over to mshertzberg@mimedia.com or the staffer that you're working with.
